### 💡 **User Stories**

**User stories** are short, simple descriptions of a feature or requirement **from the user's perspective**. 
They help development teams understand **what a user wants** and **why**—not just what the system should do.


### 🚀 **How User Stories Benefit**

| Benefit                         | Description                                                                                    |
| ------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 🧠 **User-Centered Design**     | Keeps the team focused on real user needs and goals.                                           |
| 📋 **Clarifies Requirements**   | Converts abstract features into specific, testable items.                                      |
| 🔄 **Drives Agile Development** | Forms the basis of sprints, backlogs, and testing criteria in Agile/Scrum.                     |
| 🤝 **Improves Communication**   | Ensures everyone (developers, designers, stakeholders) understands what’s being built and why. |
| ✅ **Enables Prioritization**    | Helps the team deliver the most valuable features first.                                      |

### 🗣️ Example

> "As a guest, I want to book a property so I can stay during my vacation."

✅ This clearly tells developers:

* **Who** the feature is for (a guest)
* **What** the feature is (booking a property)
* **Why** it's important (to find a place to stay)
